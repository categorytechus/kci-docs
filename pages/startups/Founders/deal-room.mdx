# Deal Room for VC
As a founder who is raising capital, you need to provide a comprehensive overview of your startup to potential investors. This deal room template will help you organize and present the necessary information effectively.
A secure, updated, and well-organized deal room can significantly enhance your chances of securing funding.
## General
Think of this as your deal room’s “table of contents.” The overview folder should act as a clear guide for navigating your data room. Include a high-level summary of each section, how your folders are structured, and any special notes investors should know before they dive in.

What to include:
- Navigation instructions (if any)
- Quick summary of what’s inside each folder
- Optional: Welcome message from the founder or CEO

## Financials
VCs need a deep understanding of your financial story. This folder should provide full visibility into how your startup makes, spends, and plans to grow revenue.

What to include:
- Historical financial statements (P&L, balance sheet, cash flow)
- Forecasts and projections
- Unit economics
- CAC vs. LTV breakdown
- Burn rate analysis and runway


## Cap Table
Transparency in ownership is crucial. Your cap table gives investors a snapshot of current equity distribution, past fundraising, and how dilution plays out.

What to include:
- Current cap table (fully diluted)
- Option pool details
- SAFE/Convertible notes (with terms and discounts)
- Past fundraising rounds and ownership breakdown
- Pro-forma post-funding structure

## Product
Showcase what you’ve built and where you’re headed. This folder demonstrates product-market fit, innovation velocity, and vision alignment.

What to include:
- Product overview deck or one-pager
- Demo videos or access to live demo/staging
- Tech stack overview
- Product roadmap
- Customer feedback or testimonials

## Team & Shareholders
VCs bet on people before numbers. Introduce your team, highlight their strengths, and show who’s already backing you.

What to include:
- Founders’ and key team bios
- Org chart (current and planned)
- Advisor list (if any)
- Shareholder list (angels, previous investors)

## Legal
To ensure legal compliance and reduce friction during diligence, make sure your legal folder is complete and clean.

What to include:
- Certificate of incorporation
- Bylaws and operating agreements
- Board resolutions
- Tax ID and licenses
- Voting agreements
- IP assignments and NDAs
- Contracts or major agreements (if relevant)

## Other Information
Add any supplementary material that deepens an investor’s understanding of your startup. These extras can demonstrate traction, vision, and thought leadership.

- KPI dashboards
- Past investor updates or newsletters
- Pitch decks (previous and current)
- Press coverage or PR highlights
- Strategic partnerships or LOIs
