# Tax Depreciation

Bonus Depreciation is a tax incentive that allows businesses to deduct a significant portion of the cost of certain assets in the year they are placed in service, rather than spreading the deduction over the asset's useful life. This can lead to substantial tax savings and improved cash flow for businesses.
It is particularly beneficial for real estate investors, as it allows them to accelerate depreciation on qualified property, including multifamily and commercial real estate.
